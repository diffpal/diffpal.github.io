# GitLab Adapter Contract (v1)

For a copy-paste GitLab CI setup, start with the
[CI setup guide](/ci-examples#gitlab-ci). This page documents adapter
behavior and publishing semantics.

## Context resolution

`Review` and `publish` for GitLab resolve target PR context in this precedence:

1. Explicit command args supplied to GitLab context resolution
2. GitLab CI variables
3. GitLab event payload (`GITLAB_EVENT_PATH`/`CI_MERGE_REQUEST_EVENT_PATH`)

Required context:

- repository/project path
- merge request IID
- base SHA (`CI_MERGE_REQUEST_DIFF_BASE_SHA` or payload `object_attributes.oldrev`)
- head SHA (`CI_COMMIT_SHA` or payload `object_attributes.last_commit.id`)
- token mode:
  - `ci_job_token` for standard CI publishing
  - `gitlab_token` when a dedicated API token is configured

## Discussion publisher

Normal CI setup should use `--feedback`:

- `summary`: posts Code Quality/SARIF artifacts and one MR summary discussion, without file-level findings.
- `review`: publishes Code Quality/SARIF artifacts, one MR summary discussion, a commit status, and file-level discussions for every publishable finding.

Severity to discussion policy:

- `high/critical`: blocking discussion that remains unresolved until manual action
- `medium/low`: advisory file-level discussion that is resolved immediately

Each finding maps to a stable thread key:

- `path + ":" + start_line + ":" + category`

Re-publishing uses key + finding ID for idempotent update/skip.

## Code Quality and SARIF

- GitLab Code Quality artifact: `.artifacts/diffpal/codequality.json`
- SARIF artifact: `.artifacts/diffpal/diffpal.sarif`
- GitLab commit status artifact: `.artifacts/diffpal/gitlab-status.json`

Both artifacts are generated from one deterministic source so dedupe keys remain stable across re-runs.

## Gating

- Tool decision: `pass` (no findings), `warn` (advisory findings), `blocked` (blocking findings), `error` (tooling failure).
- Merge blocking is represented in:
  - unresolved discussions for blockers, and
  - a GitLab commit status named `DiffPal Review` / `diffpal/review`.
- `--gate` still controls the DiffPal process exit code: blocking findings return exit code `1` after publishing succeeds.

## Operational requirements

- Config auth values:
  - `diffpal.platforms.gitlab.auth.api_token`
  - `diffpal.platforms.gitlab.auth.job_token`
- Standard CI env fallbacks are `GITLAB_TOKEN` and `CI_JOB_TOKEN`; API token is preferred over job token.
- Envsubst placeholders such as `api_token: "${GITLAB_TOKEN}"` are supported when you want config-file injection, but missing referenced variables fail config load.
- Retry policy: platform retries are batched and use exponential backoff with idempotent thread keys.
