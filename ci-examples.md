# CI Setup Guide

DiffPal's portability point is provider install and auth: CI chooses and
authenticates the provider, while DiffPal keeps the PR review workflow,
artifacts, publishing behavior, and gates consistent across hosts.

Copy-paste files live in [`examples/`](https://github.com/diffpal/diffpal/blob/main/examples/README.md). Use the
[quickstart](/quickstart) for the fastest GitHub path.

## Common Setup

Every CI system needs:

1. A full git checkout, so DiffPal can compare base and head commits.
2. The provider CLI runtime required by your selected agent.
3. A DiffPal config committed at `.config/diffpal/config.yaml`.
4. A provider auth secret.
5. A platform token so DiffPal can publish PR feedback.

Choose a ready-made provider recipe or configure `generic_acp` for your own ACP
CLI. The selected provider lives under `runtime.providers`; the CI-specific
steps are the install and authentication commands for that provider.

| Setup | Config | Required secret |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generic ACP CLI | [`examples/configs/generic-acp/config.yaml`](https://github.com/diffpal/diffpal/blob/main/examples/configs/generic-acp/config.yaml) | provider-specific |
| Codex API key | [`examples/configs/codex-api-key/config.yaml`](https://github.com/diffpal/diffpal/blob/main/examples/configs/codex-api-key/config.yaml) | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| Codex subscription auth | [`examples/configs/codex-subscription/config.yaml`](https://github.com/diffpal/diffpal/blob/main/examples/configs/codex-subscription/config.yaml) | `CODEX_AUTH_JSON_B64` |
| Copilot token | [`examples/configs/copilot-github-token/config.yaml`](https://github.com/diffpal/diffpal/blob/main/examples/configs/copilot-github-token/config.yaml) | `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| OpenCode ACP | [`examples/configs/opencode-acp/config.yaml`](https://github.com/diffpal/diffpal/blob/main/examples/configs/opencode-acp/config.yaml) | OpenCode-specific |

These setup names are accepted by `diffpal init --wizard --setup ...`.

## Using Another ACP CLI

DiffPal can use any CLI that starts an ACP stdio server. Copy the CI example
for your host, replace the provider install/authentication step with your CLI's
setup, and use a config like:

```yaml
runtime:
  providers:
    my-review-agent:
      type: generic_acp
      generic_acp:
        cmd: ["your-acp-cli", "acp", "--stdio"]

diffpal:
  provider: my-review-agent
```

The rest of the GitHub, GitLab, and Azure examples stay the same: checkout the
full git history, run DiffPal with the selected profile, and pass the platform
token for publishing feedback.

OpenCode is available as a first-class ACP alias:

```yaml
runtime:
  providers:
    opencode-acp:
      type: opencode_acp
      opencode_acp:
        model: opencode/big-pickle

diffpal:
  provider: opencode-acp
```

Install and authenticate `opencode` in CI before the DiffPal step.

## GitHub Actions

Examples:

- [Codex API key](https://github.com/diffpal/diffpal/blob/main/examples/ci/github-actions/codex-api-key.yml)
- [Codex subscription auth](https://github.com/diffpal/diffpal/blob/main/examples/ci/github-actions/codex-subscription.yml)
- [Copilot token](https://github.com/diffpal/diffpal/blob/main/examples/ci/github-actions/copilot-github-token.yml)

Required permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
```

Use a same-repository PR guard before exposing provider secrets:

```yaml
if: ${{ !github.event.pull_request.draft && github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository }}
```

What you should see:

- A PR review headed `DiffPal Review Summary`.
- Inline review comments when DiffPal finds actionable issues.
- Job failure only when `gate` is set and blocking findings exist, or when setup
  or publish fails.

## GitLab CI

Examples:

- [Codex API key](https://github.com/diffpal/diffpal/blob/main/examples/ci/gitlab/codex-api-key.yml)
- [Codex subscription auth](https://github.com/diffpal/diffpal/blob/main/examples/ci/gitlab/codex-subscription.yml)
- [Copilot token](https://github.com/diffpal/diffpal/blob/main/examples/ci/gitlab/copilot-github-token.yml)

Required variables:

| Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `CI_JOB_TOKEN` | Built-in token, when your instance allows MR API publishing. |
| `GITLAB_TOKEN` | Optional dedicated token when `CI_JOB_TOKEN` is not enough. |

Use protected/masked variables for provider tokens. If your project accepts fork
merge requests, keep provider tokens available only to trusted pipelines. The
examples restrict secret-backed review jobs to same-project merge requests with
`$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_SOURCE_PROJECT_PATH == $CI_PROJECT_PATH`.

What you should see:

- GitLab discussions for actionable findings.
- GitLab commit status named `DiffPal Review`.
- Code Quality and SARIF artifacts.
- `.artifacts/diffpal/summary.md` in job artifacts.
- Failed job when `--gate` is set and blocking findings exist.

## Azure Pipelines

Examples:

- [Codex API key](https://github.com/diffpal/diffpal/blob/main/examples/ci/azure-pipelines/codex-api-key.yml)
- [Codex subscription auth](https://github.com/diffpal/diffpal/blob/main/examples/ci/azure-pipelines/codex-subscription.yml)
- [Copilot token](https://github.com/diffpal/diffpal/blob/main/examples/ci/azure-pipelines/copilot-github-token.yml)

Required setup:

- Enable **Allow scripts to access the OAuth token**.
- Pass `SYSTEM_ACCESSTOKEN: $(System.AccessToken)` to the `DiffPalReview@1` task.
- Keep `fetchDepth: 0` on checkout.
- Run the task from PR validation or an Azure branch policy. When `base` and
  `head` are omitted, the task fetches the target branch and computes the PR
  merge-base automatically.
- Set `explain: true` while debugging to print the resolved PR id, branches,
  base/head, merge-base, and redacted CLI arguments.
- Keep credentialed steps behind `ne(variables['System.PullRequest.IsFork'], 'True')`
  or a stricter organization-specific trusted-source condition.

What you should see:

- Azure PR threads for actionable findings.
- An Azure PR summary thread headed `DiffPal Review Summary`.
- Azure PR status named `DiffPal Review`.
- Failed task when `gate` is true and blocking findings exist.

## Feedback And Outputs

Use `feedback` for normal setup:

| Feedback | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `summary` | PR/MR summary plus non-file artifacts such as status, SARIF, or Code Quality. No file-level findings are published. |
| `review` | Summary plus file-level comments, threads, or discussions for the platform. Non-blocking findings remain visible without becoming merge blockers. |

The semantic change overview is shown by default in PR reviews. Turn it off
with `summary-overview: false` in GitHub Actions or `--summary-overview=false`
on the CLI.

Default review publish surfaces:

| Platform | Default surfaces |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub | `comments,sarif,summary` |
| GitLab | `code-quality,discussions,status,sarif,summary` |
| Azure | `threads,status,summary` |

Common artifacts:

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `.artifacts/diffpal/findings.json` | Canonical structured findings bundle. |
| `.artifacts/diffpal/summary.md` | Human-readable review summary. |
| `.artifacts/diffpal/diffpal.sarif` | SARIF report when enabled by the platform output. |
| `.artifacts/diffpal/codequality.json` | GitLab Code Quality report. |

## Production Hardening

- Pin npm package versions after the first successful setup.
- Keep provider secrets out of untrusted fork pipelines.
- Start with `block_on: high`; lower the threshold only after tuning policy.
- Keep `fetch-depth: 0`, `GIT_DEPTH: "0"`, or `fetchDepth: 0` in CI.
- Run `diffpal doctor --mode <host>` before enabling a blocking gate.
