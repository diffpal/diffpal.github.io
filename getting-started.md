# Getting Started

Use this section to choose the shortest path to your first useful DiffPal
review.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, have:

- a repository on GitHub, GitLab, or Azure DevOps;
- permission to add CI configuration and repository secrets;
- one supported review provider or ACP-compatible agent;
- a pull request or merge request you can use for a trusted first test.

If the terms are new, read [How DiffPal works](/how-diffpal-works)
and the [Glossary](/glossary) first.
Before adding provider secrets, read
[Secrets and fork PRs](/secrets-and-fork-prs).

## Choose Code Host

| Host | Start here |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub Actions | [GitHub quickstart](/github-quickstart) |
| GitLab CI | [GitLab CI guide](/gitlab-ci) |
| Azure Pipelines | [Azure Pipelines guide](/azure-pipelines) |
| Custom CI/CD | [Custom CI/CD guide](/custom-ci) |

## Choose Provider

The fastest GitHub path uses the Codex API-key recipe because it is ready to
copy. Codex is not the product boundary: the same DiffPal workflow works with
other supported providers and ACP-compatible agents.

| Provider path | Start here |
| --- | --- |
| Codex API key | [GitHub quickstart](/github-quickstart) |
| Codex subscription auth, Copilot, OpenCode, or generic ACP | [Providers](/providers) |

## Choose Feedback Mode

| Mode | Use when |
| --- | --- |
| `summary` | You want a PR/MR summary and non-file artifacts without inline review comments. |
| `review` | You want the summary plus file-level comments, discussions, or PR threads. |

The GitHub quickstart uses `review` so the first run shows the full review
surface.

## Start

Use [GitHub quickstart](/github-quickstart) to install DiffPal in a new GitHub
repository, then use [Verify First Review](/verify-first-review) to confirm
the first run worked. After that, continue with [Next Steps](/next-steps).
